# dotfiles
My home directory configuration files — or dotfiles — fashioned for public reference and reuse.

These dotfiles are fashioned for macOS, but they control POSIX-like software, so could become portable. I may at some point share these dotfiles between mutiple computers which may run different operating systems.

## Developing
I manage my dotfiles with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

To initialize with one command, given [curl](https://curl.se/):
```sh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply rockygolucky
```

## Software configured
These are external links to software, as well as to internal code. Virtually everything configured is on this list alphabetically.
