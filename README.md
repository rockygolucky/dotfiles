# dotfiles
My home directory configuration files — or dotfiles — fashioned for public reference and reuse.

These dotfiles are fashioned for macOS, but they control POSIX-like software, so could become portable. I may at some point share these dotfiles between mutiple computers which may run different operating systems.

## Software configured
These are external links to software, as well as to internal code. Virtually everything configured is on this list alphabetically.
